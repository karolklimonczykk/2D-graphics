# 2D-graphics
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Application to graphical presentation of cross-sections of structural profiles.</b>
</br></br>
<p>
 The purpose of creating the application is to practically use the skills of creating and implementing interfaces and the basics of 2D graphics.
 The entire surface of the form is occupied by a graphic area where the shapes of construction profiles and text area are presented.

Each profile can be: 
<ul>
 <li>displayed</li>
 <li>selected</li>
 <li>moved by the user with the left mouse button pressed (drag) </li>
</ul>
 The application is designed in a way that allows for the easiest possible expansion by adding additional profiles. <br><br>
 Available construction shapes: Angle, C-Bar, Z-Bar, T-Bar, Double T-Bar, Rectangular pipe, Rectangular triangle,  Circle, Text area. <br>
 Each single construction profile can have a defined size, fill color, border color and position on the application screen.
